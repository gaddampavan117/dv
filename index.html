    <title>Interactive 30-Day DV360 Training Curriculum</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A three-panel layout is used to create a clear and intuitive learning environment. The left panel serves as a persistent, hierarchical navigation menu, allowing users to easily switch between phases and days. The center panel is the primary content display, presenting the detailed curriculum for the selected day. The right panel features a dynamic, interactive visualization that conceptually represents the day's topic. This structure separates navigation from content, prevents cognitive overload, and uses visual aids to reinforce complex concepts, making the curriculum more explorable and engaging than a static document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The application translates the 'Suggested Visuals' from the source report into live, interactive elements. Day 1 (Ecosystem) -> Goal: Organize -> Viz: A simple HTML/CSS flowchart showing the RTB process -> Interaction: Hover effects -> Justification: Visually simplifies a complex process. Day 2 (Hierarchy) -> Goal: Organize -> Viz: Styled HTML/Flexbox diagram -> Justification: Clearly illustrates the tiered relationships. Day 13 (KPIs/Formulas) -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Justification: Allows for easy comparison of abstract performance metrics. This approach makes learning active rather than passive. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

            { day: 1, phase: 1, title: "Introduction to Programmatic Advertising", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p>Programmatic advertising is the <b>automated buying and selling of ad space in real-time.</b> Instead of manual negotiations and human contact between advertisers and publishers, technology handles the entire process. This can be understood as a digital stock market for ad space, where every ad impression is an opportunity for an instantaneous auction.</p><p>The <b>Programmatic Ecosystem</b> is the network of technology and players that make this process possible. It primarily involves <b>Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs)</b>, which advertisers use to buy ad space, and <b>Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs)</b>, which publishers use to sell their inventory. The two meet in an <b>Ad Exchange</b>, a digital marketplace where auctions are held in milliseconds. This entire process, known as <b>Real-Time Bidding (RTB)</b>, ensures that an advertiser's ad is shown to the most relevant user, at the right time, and at the most efficient price.</p><p>The key benefits of this approach are <b>efficiency</b>, as it automates tedious manual tasks; <b>precision</b>, as it allows for incredibly detailed targeting based on user data; and <b>optimization</b>, as campaigns can be adjusted instantly based on real-time performance data.</p><h4>Basic Programmatic Advertising Terms</h4><ul><li><b>Publisher:</b> A website or app that has ad space to sell. They are the sellers.</li><li><b>Advertiser:</b> A brand or company that wants to buy ad space to promote their products. They are the buyers.</li><li><b>Ad Exchange:</b> A digital marketplace where publishers and advertisers trade ad inventory.</li><li><b>DSP (Demand-Side Platform):</b> The software advertisers use to bid on and buy ad space. DV360 is a DSP.</li><li><b>SSP (Supply-Side Platform):</b> The software publishers use to sell their ad space.</li><li><b>RTB (Real-Time Bidding):</b> The process of buying and selling ad impressions in a live auction.</li><li><b>CPM (Cost Per Mille):</b> The cost per 1,000 ad impressions. This is a common metric for pricing ad space.</li><li><b>CPC (Cost Per Click):</b> The cost for each click an ad receives.</li><li><b>CPA (Cost Per Acquisition):</b> The cost for each conversion or valuable action a user takes.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>Imagine a client, an online book retailer, wants to advertise.</p><ul><li><b>Traditional Approach:</b> They might call a few large news websites and buy ad space for a fixed price for one month. They have no idea if the people seeing the ad actually like reading books.</li><li><b>Programmatic Approach:</b> They use a DSP (like DV360) and set up a campaign to target users who have recently visited book review sites or are in an "In-Market for Books" audience segment. The ads are served only to these specific people, maximizing the ad spend.</li></ul>`, vizType: 'flow', vizData: ['User visits site', 'SSP sends ad request', 'Ad Exchange holds auction', 'DSPs place bids (RTB)', 'Highest bid wins', 'Ad is served'] },
            { day: 2, phase: 1, title: "DV360 Interface & Hierarchy", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p>The DV360 platform is organized hierarchically to keep campaigns and client data organized. This structure is essential for managing permissions, budgets, and reporting. Think of it like a company's organizational chart.</p><h4>DV360-Specific Terms</h4><ul><li><b>Partner:</b> The top level, representing your agency or company. You'll manage multiple clients under a single partner.</li><li><b>Advertiser:</b> Represents a specific client or brand. All the campaigns for a specific brand will be housed under one advertiser.</li><li><b>Campaign:</b> A broad marketing initiative with a specific objective (e.g., "Q3 Brand Awareness"). It can contain multiple insertion orders.</li><li><b>Insertion Order (IO):</b> A container for your line items that defines a budget and a schedule.</li><li><b>Line Item:</b> The most granular level. This is where you define the specific ad creative, targeting, and bidding strategy. It's the actual "ad" that gets shown to users.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>Your agency, "Digital Masters," has a client, "Shoe Co."</p><ul><li><b>Partner:</b> Digital Masters</li><li><b>Advertiser:</b> Shoe Co.</li><li><b>Campaign:</b> Summer Sneaker Launch</li><li><b>Insertion Order (IO):</b> Prospecting Campaign (Budget: $10,000)</li><li><b>Line Item:</b> Display Ad for new product (Target: 18-34, location: New York)</li></ul>`, vizType: 'hierarchy', vizData: { parent: 'Partner', children: ['Advertiser', 'Campaign', 'Insertion Order', 'Line Item'] } },
            { day: 3, phase: 1, title: "Campaign & Insertion Order Creation", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p>This day focuses on translating a marketing objective into a tangible plan within the platform. A <b>Campaign</b> defines the overall goal, name, and flight dates. An <b>Insertion Order (IO)</b> is then created within a campaign to manage a specific budget and schedule. Pacing is a critical concept here, as it controls how quickly the budget is spent.</p><ul><li><b>Even Pacing:</b> Spends the budget evenly throughout the flight dates to maintain a consistent presence.</li><li><b>Ahead/ASAP Pacing:</b> Spends the budget more aggressively to secure as many impressions as possible early in the campaign.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>Your client "Shoe Co." gives you a $10,000 budget for their summer launch.</p><ul><li><b>Campaign:</b> You create a campaign named "Summer Sneaker Launch" for June 1st to August 31st.</li><li><b>Insertion Order:</b> You create an IO named "Prospecting" with a budget of $10,000 and the same dates. You choose <b>Even Pacing</b> to ensure the ad runs throughout the summer.</li></ul>`, vizType: 'line', vizData: { labels: ['Start', 'Mid-Point', 'End'], ahead: [0, 80, 100], even: [0, 50, 100] } },
            { day: 4, phase: 1, title: "Line Items - The Building Blocks", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p>A <b>Line Item</b> is where the real work happens. It dictates what ad, where, and to whom it is shown. This is also where you'll define the bidding strategy. You must choose a line item type based on the creative format you'll be using.</p><ul><li><b>Display:</b> Standard banner ads (e.g., JPG, GIF) and HTML5 ads.</li><li><b>Video:</b> In-stream (pre-roll, mid-roll) and out-stream video ads.</li><li><b>Audio:</b> Ads that play on streaming audio services like Spotify.</li><li><b>Native:</b> Ads that match the look and feel of the surrounding content.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>For the "Prospecting" IO for "Shoe Co.", you create two line items:</p><ul><li><b>Line Item 1:</b> A Display ad targeting users interested in running.</li><li><b>Line Item 2:</b> A Video ad targeting users who have watched fitness-related content on YouTube.</li></ul>`, vizType: 'doughnut', vizData: { labels: ['Display', 'Video', 'Audio', 'Native'], values: [45, 35, 10, 10] } },
            { day: 5, phase: 1, title: "Introduction to Targeting", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p>Targeting allows you to serve ads to the most relevant users, maximizing efficiency and minimizing wasted spend. You can target users based on a variety of criteria.</p><ul><li><b>Demographic:</b> Age, gender, household income.</li><li><b>Geographic:</b> Country, region, city, or even a specific postal code.</li><li><b>Audience:</b> Reaching users based on their interests, past online behavior, or what they are actively researching.</li><li><b>Contextual:</b> Serving ads on websites with content related to your brand.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>For a new camping gear company, you can combine targeting types to find the ideal customer:</p><ul><li><b>Demographic:</b> Men and women, age 25-54.</li><li><b>Geographic:</b> The US and Canada.</li><li><b>Audience:</b> Users in the "Outdoor Enthusiasts" audience segment who are actively researching "camping gear."</li><li><b>Contextual:</b> Ad placement on blogs about hiking and camping.</li></ul>`, vizType: 'bar', vizData: { labels: ['Demographic', 'Geographic', 'Audience', 'Contextual'], values: [7, 8, 10, 6] } },
            { day: 6, phase: 1, title: "Audience-Based Targeting", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p>Diving deeper into audience targeting, you can leverage several data sources for maximum precision.</p><ul><li><b>First-Party Data:</b> Your own customer data, such as a list of users who have visited your website but didn't make a purchase. This is the most valuable and powerful data.</li><li><b>Third-Party Data:</b> Data purchased from external data providers to reach new users.</li><li><b>Google Audiences:</b> Proprietary segments from Google, such as <b>Affinity Audiences</b> (broad interests) and <b>In-Market Audiences</b> (users actively researching a product).</li><li><b>Combined Audiences:</b> Custom lists created by layering different audience segments to create a highly specific target group.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>To target the perfect audience for a new luxury car model:</p><ul><li><b>First-Party:</b> Retarget users who have visited the car's web page.</li><li><b>Third-Party:</b> Target a list of "high net-worth individuals."</li><li><b>Google Audiences:</b> Target users in the "In-Market for Luxury Sedans" audience.</li><li><b>Combined:</b> Target users who are "In-Market for Luxury Sedans" AND have visited a competitor's website.</li></ul>`, vizType: 'radar', vizData: { labels: ['1st Party', '3rd Party', 'Affinity', 'In-Market', 'Custom'], values: [10, 7, 6, 8, 9] } },
            { day: 7, phase: 1, title: "Creative Management", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p><b>Creatives</b> are the actual ads that users see. It's crucial to adhere to the specifications for each ad format and to use a variety of creatives to engage different audiences.</p><ul><li><b>Standard Creatives:</b> Simple image ads (JPG, GIF) or static video files.</li><li><b>HTML5 Creatives:</b> Interactive and dynamic ads built with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.</li><li><b>Creative Assignment:</b> After creatives are uploaded, they must be assigned to the appropriate line items to serve.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>For the "Shoe Co." campaign:</p><ul><li><b>Line Item 1 (Display):</b> You upload a simple JPG banner ad and an interactive HTML5 creative and set them to rotate evenly to see which performs better.</li><li><b>Line Item 2 (Video):</b> You upload a 15-second video ad that highlights the product's features.</li></ul>`, vizType: 'bar', vizData: { labels: ['Standard (JPG/GIF)', 'HTML5', 'Video'], values: [6, 9, 8] } },
            { day: 8, phase: 1, title: "Brand Safety & Ad Fraud", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p>Brand safety and ad fraud are critical concerns in digital advertising. DV360 has built-in tools to protect a brand's reputation and ad spend.</p><ul><li><b>Brand Suitability Controls:</b> You can use pre-bid settings to avoid unsafe inventory and exclude websites that don't meet a certain standard.</li><li><b>Keyword Exclusion Lists:</b> You can upload lists of keywords to prevent your ads from appearing next to undesirable content.</li><li><b>Verification Vendors:</b> You can integrate with third-party vendors (like DoubleVerify or Integral Ad Science) to measure viewability and detect ad fraud in real-time.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>Your client, a family-friendly food brand, is concerned about their ads appearing next to controversial content.</p><ul><li><b>Action:</b> You apply a keyword exclusion list for terms like "politics," "disaster," and "crime."</li><li><b>Verification:</b> You enable a third-party verification vendor to monitor ad placements and ensure viewability.</li></ul>`, vizType: 'text', vizData: "Brand safety is about protecting your client's most valuable asset: their reputation." },
            { day: 9, phase: 1, title: "Floodlight Tags & Conversion Tracking", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p><b>Floodlight tags</b> are snippets of code placed on a website to track user actions, such as making a purchase, filling out a form, or signing up for a newsletter.</p><ul><li><b>Conversion Tracking:</b> Floodlight tags are essential for measuring the success of a campaign. They tell you which ads led to a valuable action on your website.</li><li><b>Retargeting Lists:</b> They are also used to build first-party audience lists. For example, you can create a list of users who added a product to their cart but didn't complete the purchase, allowing you to retarget them with a specific ad later.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>Your client, "Shoe Co.," wants to track purchases.</p><ul><li><b>Implementation:</b> You create a Floodlight tag for "Purchases" and place it on the order confirmation page.</li><li><b>Retargeting:</b> You also create a Floodlight tag for "Add to Cart" and place it on the shopping cart page.</li></ul>`, vizType: 'flow', vizData: ['User sees ad', 'Clicks to website', 'Makes a purchase', 'Floodlight tag fires', 'Conversion recorded'] },
            { day: 10, phase: 1, title: "Phase 1 Review & Practical Exercise", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p>This day is for a comprehensive review of the first nine days and a hands-on exercise to solidify the foundational knowledge. It's a chance for trainees to put theory into practice.</p><h4>Practical Example</h4><p><b>Client Brief:</b> A brand named "Gourmet Coffee" wants to launch a new line of coffee beans. Their goal is to drive awareness and initial sales.</p><ul><li><b>Task:</b> Create the full campaign structure in DV360, including the Partner, Advertiser, Campaign, and at least one Insertion Order with two line items.</li><li><b>Instructions:</b> Set the campaign objective as "Awareness & Sales," set a fictional budget, assign appropriate targeting for each line item, and explain which Floodlight tags you would use.</li></ul>`, vizType: 'text', vizData: "Time to apply your knowledge! Let's build a campaign from scratch." },
            { day: 11, phase: 2, title: "Introduction to Bidding Strategies", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p>DV360 offers various bidding strategies to achieve different goals. A bidding strategy is the method you use to determine how much you're willing to pay for an ad impression.</p><ul><li><b>Manual Bidding:</b> You set the price yourself. This gives you full control but requires constant monitoring.</li><li><b>Automated Bidding:</b> Uses Google's machine learning to automatically adjust bids to achieve a specific outcome, such as <b>Target CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)</b> or <b>Maximize Conversions</b>.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>You're running a campaign for "Gourmet Coffee."</p><ul><li><b>Goal:</b> Drive website sign-ups at a cost of $5 per sign-up.</li><li><b>Action:</b> You use a <b>Target CPA</b> automated bidding strategy and set the target to $5.</li></ul>`, vizType: 'bar', vizData: { labels: ['Control', 'Efficiency'], manual: [10, 4], automated: [5, 10] } },
            { day: 12, phase: 2, title: "Frequency & Pacing", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p>These controls are vital for a good user experience and effective budget management.</p><ul><li><b>Frequency Capping:</b> Limits how many times a unique user sees your ad in a given period (e.g., 3 impressions per user per day). This prevents ad fatigue.</li><li><b>Pacing:</b> Controls the rate at which an Insertion Order's budget is spent. <b>Even pacing</b> distributes the budget evenly, while <b>Ahead or ASAP pacing</b> spends it more aggressively.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>Your client, a local gym, wants to run a brand awareness campaign.</p><ul><li><b>Frequency:</b> You set a frequency cap of 3 per day to ensure people in the area are reminded of the brand without feeling spammed.</li><li><b>Pacing:</b> For a two-week campaign leading up to an event, you might use <b>Ahead Pacing</b> to build up hype.</li></ul>`, vizType: 'line', vizData: { labels: ['Start', 'Mid-Point', 'End'], ahead: [0, 80, 100], even: [0, 50, 100] } },
            { day: 13, phase: 2, title: "Introduction to Optimization", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p><b>Optimization</b> is a continuous process of making data-driven adjustments to improve campaign performance. This involves monitoring Key Performance Indicators (<b>KPIs</b>) and making changes to improve them.</p><ul><li><b>CTR (Click-Through Rate):</b> Clicks ÷ Impressions. Measures ad engagement.</li><li><b>CPC (Cost Per Click):</b> Total cost ÷ Clicks. Measures cost efficiency of clicks.</li><li><b>CPA (Cost Per Acquisition):</b> Total cost ÷ Conversions. Measures cost of a valuable action.</li><li><b>ROAS (Return On Ad Spend):</b> Total revenue ÷ Total spend. Measures profitability.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>Your "Gourmet Coffee" campaign has a great CTR but a high CPA. This means people are clicking, but not converting. You might adjust the ad creative to be more direct or improve the landing page.</p>`, vizType: 'bar', vizData: { labels: ['CTR', 'CPA', 'ROAS'], values: [7, 9, 10] } },
            { day: 14, phase: 2, title: "Creative Optimization", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p>Testing and improving ad creatives is key to boosting performance.</p><ul><li><b>A/B Testing:</b> This involves running two or more versions of an ad to see which performs better. This is a fundamental part of optimization.</li><li><b>Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO):</b> An advanced technique that allows for creating personalized ads at scale by swapping out elements like images and text based on user data.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>For the "Gourmet Coffee" campaign, you create two banner ads: Creative A (a cup of coffee) and Creative B (the coffee beans). After one week, Creative A has a higher CTR. You pause Creative B and allocate the full budget to the winning creative.</p>`, vizType: 'text', vizData: "Always be testing. A small change in creative can lead to a big change in results." },
            { day: 15, phase: 2, title: "Targeting & Bidding Optimization", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p>Use campaign data to refine targeting and bids. This is about making smart, surgical changes rather than broad ones.</p><ul><li><b>Excluding Underperformers:</b> Analyze performance reports to identify and exclude underperforming websites, apps, or audience segments.</li><li><b>Bid Adjustments:</b> Increase bids for high-performing audiences or geographic locations.</li><li><b>Audience Expansion:</b> If a line item is performing well, consider expanding its audience to find new potential customers.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>Your campaign report shows that a certain website is spending 20% of your budget but has zero conversions. You <b>exclude that website</b> from your campaign to stop the wasted spend.</p>`, vizType: 'flow', vizData: ['Analyze Reports', 'Find Outliers', 'Adjust Bids/Exclusions', 'Monitor & Repeat'] },

You use DV360 to target users who have recently searched for similar film genres on Google, are in an "in-market for movies" audience, and are on a TV device.</p>`, vizType: 'text', vizData: "DV360 unlocks advanced audience strategies for YouTube campaigns." },
            { day: 18, phase: 2, title: "Cross-Device Targeting", content: `<h4>Key Concepts & Explanations</h4><p>DV360 uses a privacy-safe <b>device graph</b> to connect a user's activity across their phone, tablet, and desktop. This allows for delivering a cohesive ad experience across a user's entire digital journey.</p><ul><li><b>Cohesive Messaging:</b> You can show an initial awareness ad on a user's phone, then a more direct call-to-action ad on their desktop.</li><li><b>Accurate Frequency Capping:</b> You can set a frequency cap that applies to a user, not just a single device.</li></ul><h4>Practical Example</h4><p>A user sees a backpack ad on their phone. Later that evening, they are on their desktop and see a retargeting ad for the same backpack with a "10% off" offer.
